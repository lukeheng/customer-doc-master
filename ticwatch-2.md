1.Why can’t Mobvoi upgrade TicWatch 2 to Wear OS

TicWatch 2及其每个硬件都是专为TicWear设计的。 要完全迁移到另一个平台，产品（操作系统，芯片，组件和我们）中涉及的所有合作伙伴都需要从头开始，从而可以为新产品创建良好的用户体验。 我们探测了Wear OS（当时称为Android Wear）的开关，团队起初很乐观。 但是，经过几轮的评估，不止一个合作伙伴无法投入时间和资源来确保迁移和用户体验符合每个人的标准。 实际上，我们非常担心不能达到让用户满意的体验，而且一直处于糟糕的体验。 这是一个艰难的决定，但我们更大的错误是当时没有对此进行交流。 与所有正处于发展中的公司一样，团队更换了。 我所参与的现有团队知道我们不能让这种情况继续恶化，我们现在必须做正确的事情并与你们讨论。 这就是我要做的。

TicWatch 2 and each of its hardware components were all designed specifically for TicWear. To migrate entirely to another platform takes all partners involved in the product \(OS, chip, components and us\) to start from scratch to create a good user experience with the new product. We explored the switch to Wear OS \(then called Android Wear\) and the team was optimistic at first. However, after a couple of rounds of assessment phases, more than one partner could not commit the time and resources to making sure the migration and the user experience would meet everyone’s standards. In fact, there was much concern that the user experience would never reach satisfactory levels, and would simple remain an unsatisfactory experience. It was a tough decision, but our biggest mistake was not communicating this at the time.

  
2.Why is there no communication between Mobvoi and TicWatch 2 users for such a long time

我们不是在为此找借口。 作为一个团队，我们之前没有与你们沟通过这个问题我们错了。 我们自己的内部问题，这些问题在于我们仍然乐观地认为可以在迁移到Wear OS方面做些什么。 当这一点明显不会发生迁移时，想将其变为现实所怀有的希望，也会对这里的团队造成严重的侵袭。 这是我们犯了错误的地方; 我们应该让你们知道。 虽然我们仍然对迁移抱有希望（也许是太长时间），但我们应该让你们实时了解更新。 它成了一个糟糕的循环，“我们应该告诉他们”，但“如果我们能够克服障碍怎么办？”，直到达到这一点。 所陈述的内容都不会影响我们与您的沟通。 我们应该做得更好并考虑您这样的我们的第一批支持者的感受。 我们再次真诚地为此道歉。 说完这些并继续前进，我们想重新开始并与TicWatch 2用户进行沟通，真正了解问题所在，并找出解决问题的方法。 对于所有悬而未决的问题我们可以做的依然有局限性，但我们不希望沉默继续下去。 我们宁愿沉住气，并保持透明。 这就是我们伸出援手的原因。 此外，对于每天致力于客户支持的团队，当我们看到“TW2受害者”时，真的让我们心碎！ 我们在一天结束时也是消费者，我们绝对能感受到被公司和品牌遗弃或遗忘的痛苦和挫败感。

There is no explaining away this. Mobvoi was mistaken to not communicate with Ticwatch 2 users more frequently. It was our own internal issues and problems that were rooted in still being optimistic that something could be done regarding a migration to Wear OS. Holding on to this hope and wanting this to become reality created large issues for the team when it slowly moved out of the realm of possibility. This is where we dropped the ball; we should’ve let our Ticwatch 2 base know. While we still held out hope that we could still do something about the migration, we could have given updates more frequently. It became a repetitive cycle of, “We should tell them.”, but “What if we can overcome the limitations?”, until it’s reached this point. None of what’s been described should have affected our communications with you. We clearly should have done better and taken care of you, our first supporters. Again, we do sincerely apologize for that. Having said that and moving forward, we’d like to start again and open up communications with TicWatch 2 users, to really hear what the issues are, and to figure out one way or the other if we can fix any of those issues. There will still be limitations with what we can do about all outstanding issues, but we don’t want the silence to continue. We’d rather take our lumps and be transparent. This is why we’re reaching out.

3.Why are there no further updates for TicWear

这似乎很难相信，但我们的资源有限。 虽然我们可能已经不再是一个传统的创业公司，但我们仍然不是那些与我们竞争的国际集团。 我们目前正在TicWatch 2上用TicWear进行维护。 我们的工程团队一直致力于为用户打造最佳的智能手表体验。 话虽如此，随着我们的成长，尤其是招聘无法跟上我们提供的机会，资源也逐渐减少。 当我们开始与其他合作伙伴合作时，由于合作的数量和规模，我们自己的工程资源的负担也增加了。 事实上，我们最终决定转换平台（从TicWear到Wear OS）的部分原因是因为我们需要能为我们提供的资源支持的合作伙伴。 虽然TicWear未来不会更新，但我们确实希望继续解决影响大多数用户的主要问题。其中一些我想做的是收集更多当前影响活跃用户的主要问题的信息，获取这些信息并了解我们的工程团队可以做些什么。 我无法承诺对所有内容进行快速修复，但过程将是： 收集数据 与产品经理和工程师分享 他们一般进行可行性研究： 我们能解决吗？ 我们能解决多少问题 什么时候能解决 在那之后，我将达成退回协议并分享现实的解决方案和时间表。 如果/当我们得知没有解决方案时，可能仍会让用户感到失望。 然而，我/我们相信，令人失望的答案总比不知道要好。 我/我们在这里，特别是在客户支持方面的新人将竭尽全力与您一起共度难关。 \*询问产品团队的更新/补丁历史记录，并可能查阅半支持历史记录。

  
This may seem hard to believe, but we are limited with our resources. While we may have outgrown being a traditional startup, we still aren’t the international conglomerates that we compete with everyday. We’re currently taking a maintenance approach with TicWear on TicWatch 2. Our engineering teams have always been focusing on building the best smartwatch experience for our users. Having said that, resources were thinned out as we grew and especially as hiring couldn’t keep up with the opportunities presented to us. As we started working with other partnerships, the burden on our own engineering resources also grew due to the volume and size of the collaborations. In fact, part of the reason why we ultimately decided to switch platforms \(from TicWear to Wear OS\) was because we needed the resource support that a big partner could afford us. While there won’t be future updates for TicWear, we do want to continue fixing major issues that affect high percentage of users. Part of what I want to do is to collect more information on the major issues currently affecting active users, take that information and see what our engineering teams can do. I cannot promise quick fixes on everything, but the process will be: Collect data Share with product managers and engineers Following this, they will ask: "Can we fix this?" "How much of this issue can we fix and what will it cost?" "When can we fix this?" After that, I’ll be able to reach back out and share realistic solutions and timelines. There will probably still be a lot of disappointed users if/when we learn that there is no solution. However, it is my/our belief that a disappointing answer is better than not knowing. We are here and that goes especially for the new guard in customer support who are dedicated to seeing this through. \*Ask about update/patch history with product team and potentially refer to a history of semi-support.
