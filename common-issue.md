#### 42**.为什么手表在卫生纸/苹果/香蕉/水果/桌面上有时也能测出心率？Why does my watch sometimes measure heart rate on toilet paper / apple / banana / fruit / desktop? \(Universal for all wear os models and android/ios phones\)**

目前手表/手环上采用的基本都是光电容积脉搏波描记法（PPG）。

简单来说，探测器会发射一定波长的光束照射到皮肤，之后光束会通过透射和反射的方式传到光线接收器，而在这个过程中，由于肌肉和血液对光线的吸收衰减作用，接收到的光线强度会有一定程度的减弱，而皮肤、肌肉和血液对光的吸收基本上是恒定的，最主要影响光线吸收的是皮肤内的血液容积，这个容积大小是随着心脏的舒张与收缩变化的，所以接收器收到的光信号强度也会呈现脉动性变化，再将光信号转化为电信号放大，通过算法就能确定容积脉搏血流和心率变化。至于为什么心率测量都采用绿光，是因为 对于红色的血液来说绿光的吸收效率最高。

但为什么卫生纸会测出来心率？回头再去看原理会发现，PPG 测量主要依靠的是光线反射，这其实意味着只要光线反射变化的规律在一定的范围内，就有可能会被算法拟合成心率读数，尽管这时你可能并没有戴在手腕上。所以像卫生纸、杯子、玩偶、水果等绝大部分会反光的事物贴上去都可能会有心率数据。这是反射式光电心率测定法原理导致的。某些水果、卫生纸等在内的植物纤维是光信号的良好反射体，而软件将反射的光信号的涨落拟合为心率，这导致算法误以为被测物体是手腕。目前的光学心率测量还没有有效的算法来区别被测物体是手腕还是某些水果、卫生纸等无生命的物体。

除了 PPG 测量方法外，还有其他一些测量方法比较常见，比如在医院中是通过电极片直接测量心电信号在体表的微小差距，心率带也是基于同样的原理，虽然在数据上更加精准，但这种方法难以做到小型化和便携化。另外还有血氧法测量，比如三星 S6 自带的光电传感器，不过血氧法对透光性要求较高，多用在测量指尖和耳垂。

At present, the basic methods used on watches / bands are photoelectric volume pulse angiography \(PPG\).

In simple terms, the detector emits a certain wavelength of light to illuminate the skin, and then the light beam is transmitted to the light receiver through transmission and reflection. In this process, due to the absorption and attenuation of light by muscle and blood, the intensity of the received light will be weakened to a certain extent, and the absorption of light by the skin, muscles and blood is basically constant. The most important influence on the absorption of light is the blood volume in the skin. This blood volume is changed due to the relaxation and contraction of the heart. so the intensity of the optical signal received by the receiver will also show a pulsating change, and then the optical signal is converted into an electric signal to amplify, and the volume of pulse blood flow and heart rate changes can be determined through an algorithm. As for why heart rate measurement uses green light, it is because green blood has the highest absorption efficiency for red blood.

But why does toilet paper measure heart rate? Looking back at the principle, you will find that the PPG measurement mainly relies on light reflection, which actually means that as long as the law of light reflection changes within a certain range, it may be fitted to the heart rate reading by the algorithm, although you may It is not worn on the wrist. So most things that are reflective, like toilet paper, cups, dolls, fruits, etc., may have heart rate data. This is due to the principle of reflective photoelectric heart rate measurement. Some plant fibers, including fruits and toilet paper, are good reflectors of light signals, and the software fits the fluctuations of the reflected light signals to heart rate, which causes the algorithm to mistakenly think that the measured object is the wrist. Currently, there is no effective algorithm for optical heart rate measurement to distinguish whether the measured object is the wrist or some inanimate objects such as fruits and toilet paper.

In addition to the PPG measurement method, there are other measurement methods that are more common. For example, in hospitals, the small gap between the ECG signal and the body surface is directly measured through the electrode pads. The heart rate band is also based on the same principle, although the data is more accurate. But this method is difficult to achieve miniaturization and portability. There are also blood oxygen measurements, such as the photoelectric sensor that comes with the Samsung S6, but the blood oxygen method has higher requirements for light transmission, and is mostly used to measure fingertips and earlobe.

#### 43**.健康中心里的步长不正确，导致显示的距离比实际大，比如我实际走了5000步，大约有3km，但手表告诉我有5km，怎么解决？- The step length in the health center is incorrect, which causes the displayed distance to be longer than the actual one. For example, I actually walked 5000 steps, which is about 3km, but the watch tells me that I have 5km. How to do it? \(Universal for all wear os models and android/ios phones\)**

![](http://123.59.135.217:4000/assets/微信截图_20191122172007.png)

感谢您的反馈，健康中心的距离显示=\(当日步数x步长\)+当日TicExercise运动距离\(如果当天使用过\)。步长是根据您在Mobvoi app中输入的身高体重信息来自动估算的，请确认您在Mobvoi app中填写的身高体重信息是否准确。另外，我们会在新版本Mobvoi app中增加手动输入步长的功能，从而使用户可以手动调整步长。

**另外，以下内容仅供内部共享，不得发给用户：**

1.如果用户未设置过身高体重，则步长默认为70cm。

2.如果用户身高＞193cm,则步长固定为72cm。

3.如果用户身高＜150cm，则步长固定为56cm。

4.如果用户身高介于150-193之间，则计算公式为：\(8.83569e-7\*实际身高³\)-\(0.00051355\*实际身高²\)+\(0.101438\*实际身高\)-6.08792

Thanks for your feedback, the distance display of the health center = \(steps of the day x step length\) + TicExercise distance of the day \(if used on the day\). The step length is automatically estimated based on the height and weight information you entered in the Mobvoi app. Please confirm that the height and weight information you entered in the Mobvoi app is accurate. In addition, we will add the function of manually entering the step size in the new version of the Mobvoi app, so that users can manually adjust the step size.

**In addition, the following content is for internal sharing only and DO NOT share to users:**

1. If the user has not set the height and weight, the step length defaults to 70cm.

2. If the user's height is&gt; 193cm, the step length is fixed at 72cm.

3. If the user's height is &lt;150cm, the step size is fixed at 56cm.

4. If the user's height is between 150-193, the calculation formula is: \(8.83569e-7 \* actual height³\)-\(0.00051355 \* actual height²\) + \(0.101438 \* actual height\) -6.08792
