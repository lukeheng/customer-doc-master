#### 69. 耳机的省电技巧。

#### What would be recommended to improve battery life?

收到耳机，先充满电再使用哦。可以通过以下操作来提升您耳机的续航时间：

1，音频编码格式：AAC最省电，然后是SBC，最费电的是APTX；（我们是支持AAC与APTX的）

2，音量：适当降低音量可以提升续航时间，还可以保护耳膜；

3，在非安静环境下使用快捷口令，语音助手，头部控制等功能会消耗更多的电量。

刚收到货，耳机首次充电需要几个周期进行激活。当充电盒上显示红灯代表电量不足，可以插上充电插头充电，直至充电盒上显示长亮的绿灯。多次使用充电，一周后可以达到稳定的状态，建议咱们再使用下呢。

When you receive the TicPods, please kindly fully charge it before using for the first time. Here are some power saving tips that may help to improve battery life:

Audio format: AAC would be the most power-saving choice, then SBC, and the most power-consuming is APTX.

Volume: please reducing the volume appropriately, which can help improve the battery life and protect your eardrum;

Using functions such as Quick Command, voice assistant, and Head Gesture Control in a noisy environment will consume more power.

For a newly received product, it will take several charging cycles to fully activate the TicPods battery. Repeat several times the discharge and charge cycles and the battery capacity should be stabilized in the right condition.

A：1. Put the Ticpods back into the charging box, and press the function key for 16s in the box, or until you see the the cyan light of the earphone box flash. Then the factory reset will take effect.

Clear ticpods from paired bluetooth device list on your phone and start the pairing process again.
