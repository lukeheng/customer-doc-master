The Android Wear app \(installed from Google Play or Apple App Store\)

This is applicable to Android users only. Ensuring apps are up to date. Specifically, it’s important that the Google Search and Google Play Services apps are up to date

Being in range \(Bluetooth\) - The wearable and phone should be within 5-meters \(~15-feet\) of one another

The watch is a Bluetooth Smart device \(formerly known as Bluetooth LE / low energy\). This Bluetooth technology uses lower energy than a traditional Bluetooth device, such as audio speakers, headsets, car, etc.

In addition, you can be connected to multiple Bluetooth devices, while also being connected to a wearable

Active data connection - During initial setup, the phone needs a data connection to check if an OTA \(over-the-air\) update is available

Check phone/tablet compatibility

Verify Android Wear app has been installed on the phone/tablet

Ensure app versions are up to date for Android users:

Google Play service app

Google Search app

Verify phone/tablet and wearable are within range \(5 meters / ~15 feet\).

Make sure have the phone and watch within arm’s reach of one another.

Note: Different objects \(e.g., metal, concrete, and more\) can cause signal interference, which can decrease range and affect the quality of the connection.

The available speakers on the market at the time we were developing the TicWatch S2 and TicWatch E2 would not allow us to keep our 5 ATM waterproof rating. Ultimately, we saw in our regular check-ins with our user community that there was a greater need for waterproof watches than there was for a built-in speaker. While using a Bluetooth earphone is a solution for not having a speaker, there is no troubleshooting solution for being waterproof and swim-ready.

#### 97、H版本卡顿    H system version stuck\(C2/S2/E2\)

1.如果配对完成后的一段时间内操作卡顿：在H版本上，为了确保用户能够获得更好的体验，当配对完成后，Google play store会自动联网下载安装app的更新，此时占用的系统内存比较大，可能造成手表卡顿。

建议：配对完成后，佩戴2小时后即可改善。

2.平时操作时有时卡顿：在H版本上，系统会根据应用使用的频率和程度去配置系统资源，所以可能会出现首次使用或者使用不频繁的应用出现卡顿现象，属于正常情况，这样做带来的好处是延长手表的续航。

3.IOS手机卡顿：在配对过程中根据Wear os app的操作提示连接wifi。配对完成后尝试重启后使用。

1.The H system is frozen after you've completed the pairing process:

With the H version, in order to ensure that users can get a better experience, when the pairing is completed, Google Play Store will automatically download and install app updates online. At this time, the occupied system memory is relatively large, which may cause watch's interface to freeze.

Suggestion: After the pairing is completed, the watch should perform properly within two hours

2.Watch continues to freeze under normal usage:

With the H version, the system will configure system resources according to the frequency and degree of application usage. There may be continous freezing upon the first time using applications. This is normal. The advantage of doing this is to lengthen battery life.

3.Frozen for IOS phonedevices: Please connect with Wifi based on the Wear OS app guide while you are first pairing and restart the watch/WearOS app after this.
