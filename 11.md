1. Could you tell me how fast the watch is currently lasting or losing charge? 2. Could you tell me your usage habits and commonly used apps? These factors could affect battery life. - Battery Saving Factors: Airplane Mode Switched On, "Always On-screen" mode switched Off, Fitness apps not used. Thebattery should last 40-48 hours in this cicumstance. - If Fitness apps are used and large number of notifications are coming in via Bluetooth, and "Always on-screen" mode is switched On for about half an hour. Battery standby time could reduce by about 50%-60%. - If Fitness apps like Google Fit Workout and Mobvoi FItness/TicPulse are used, GPS is turned on and Heartrate monitor is turned on, then battery consumption will be even higher: Approx. 25% per hour. So, - Do you use Fitness Tracking Apps often? - Is the "Always On-screen" mode enabled? - Are Bluetooth and Wifi always switched on? - Is GPS always switched on? - Is the Heartrate monitor switched on? These are the more battery-consuming apps that will reduce the battery life if switched on for a prolonged period of time. 3. Please ensure that the software version is up to date \(under Settings -
