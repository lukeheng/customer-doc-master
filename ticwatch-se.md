#### 5. 耗电严重\(Ticwatch S/E\)    Battery Life Issues

1、想了解您的耗电程度如何？

2、确认一下您的日常使用习惯和使用模式，因为不同使用模式下的带机时长是不同的。比如省电情况下，开启飞行模式、关闭微光常亮、不使用运动功能可使用40-48小时。如果使用运动APP ，通过手机同步大量消息，手表亮屏使用半个小时，待机时间会减少大约50%-60%。如果使用运动APP如Google fit workout, Mobvoi fitness 户外运动, 开启GPS，开启心率，耗电则会更严重，约25%/小时。所以请问您是否经常使用运动功能、经常亮屏、通过手机同步消息的频率如何？GPS是否经常开启？心率是否开启等，这些APP都是比较耗电的，经常开启会减少待机时长。

3、请确保手表软件更新至最新版本，可通过以下步骤进行更新：手表设置-关于- 勾选checking updates

4、如以上步骤无法解决您问题，我们会为您提供免费换新。您可以通过以下官网申请换新：[http://support.mobvoi.com/](http://support.mobvoi.com/)

5、顺便为您提供一些省电tips：首次使用请及时充电，首次使用配对会消耗较多电量，属于正常显现，及时充电几个循环即可改善。

6、增加日常使用时长的小技巧：关闭微光常亮模式、使用偏深色表盘、关闭不必要的消息通知、不使用手表Wifi时，及时手动关闭Wifi、夜间开启飞行模式

7、整个过程欢饮随时反馈以便于我我们了解具体情况，对产品进行持续的改进。

1. Could you tell me how fast the watch is currently lasting or losing charge?

2. Could you tell me your usage habits and commonly used apps? These factors could affect battery life.

3. Battery Saving Factors: Airplane Mode Switched On, "Always On-screen" mode switched Off, Fitness apps not used. Thebattery should last 40-48 hours in this cicumstance.

4. If Fitness apps are used and large number of notifications are coming in via Bluetooth, and "Always on-screen" mode is switched On for about half an hour. Battery standby time could reduce by about 50%-60%.

5. If Fitness apps like Google Fit Workout and Mobvoi FItness/TicPulse are used, GPS is turned on and Heartrate monitor is turned on, then battery consumption will be even higher: Approx. 25% per hour.

So,

* Do you use Fitness Tracking Apps often?

* Is the "Always On-screen" mode enabled?

* Are Bluetooth and Wifi always switched on?

* Is GPS always switched on?

* Is the Heartrate monitor switched on?

These are the more battery-consuming apps that will reduce the battery life if switched on for a prolonged period of time.

1. Please ensure that the software version is up to date \(under Settings -&gt;System -&gt;About -&gt;System updates\).

2. If the above steps do not help to solve your issue, please apply for a warranty via this link [http://support.mobvoi.com/](http://support.mobvoi.com/)

We will review your request and issue you with a replacement.

1. Here are some battery saving tips that you may find useful:

   * when first using your Ticwatch, please charge the battery. Pairing with your phone and using it at first may consume more battery than usual. This is normal, fully recharge the battery and it should stabilise after a few cycles.

2. Further tips to improve the battery life:

   * Disable "Always on-screen" mode.

   * Use a slightly darker colour watch face.

   * Disable unnecessary app notifications.

   * Switch off Wifi and GPS when not in use.

   * Switch on airplane mode during the night.

3. Please do not hesitate to provide as much feedback as possible on your watch performance in different scenarios. We would really appreciate it so that we can continue to make improvements to the product.

1. The battery saving function on the watch disconnects the connection with iOS. Ensure that your watch is always charged and not in power saving mode.

2. Ensure that your watch and phone are always within Bluetooth range. Should they ever be out of range and disconnect, iOS will likely disable the auto re-connection and you have to manually pair them again.

3. If you have problem pairing after the connection is killed off, put the watch on airplane mode for 10 seconds before off-ing it. Sometimes, you also have to manually open the Wear app and tap on the watch image on the home screen for the watch to reconnect with the phone.

#### 165. 手表是否可以独立使用，不带手机？    Can the watch be used as standalone, without bringing my phone?

这取决于您想要使用哪种功能。

对于呼叫/接收短信，手表本身无法完成此功能，您应确保手表通过蓝牙与手机成功配对，建议在5米范围内使用。

对于像谷歌地图这样的从Google play商店下载的一些应用程序，以及手表上的一些应用程序，如医疗保健，心率跟踪，gps，他们可以独立工作，无需电话。

但是，如果您要更新手表上的应用，则仍需要将其与手机连接，同时连接到充电线。

It depends which kind of function you want to use.

For calling/receive text messages, the watch cannot fulfill the function by itself, you should make sure the watch is paired successfully via Bluetooth with the phone, and It is recommended to use within a distance of 5 metres.

The one exception to this is the Ticwatch Pro 4G \(Verizon\) model, which can connect to its phone network by itself if setup with Verizon. You may recieve calls and texts without a phone in this case.

For some apps downloaded from google play store like google map,  and some apps on the watch like health care, heart rate tracking, gps, they can work independently without phone.

But if you want to update apps on your watch, you still need to connect it with your phone, while connect to charging cable."

* 对于Android用户：在手机上，转到设置 - &gt;语言和键盘 - &gt;添加语言，然后选择要更改的语言。

1.During the initial pairing process, you can choose the language that you want. The app language for the Ticwatch is the same as the one on your phone.

1. If you need to change the language settings for third-party apps, please verify with the app developer.

2. If you have already setup and paired successfully, and you wish to change the app language on the Ticwatch, please do the following:

#### 167.  配对手表时，copy不了手机的google账号    When pairing with the Ticwatch, I cannot copy the Google account from my phone.

#### 181. 手表无法阅读短信内容,是否是通过下载android messages app才能阅读到短信内容    Cannot read SMS messages on the watch. Do I need to download Android Messages app in order to read SMS messages?

不是所有手机都需要安装app,手表商没有默认短信app。

（知识了解：不用告知用户）

有些手机是原生安卓，比如google pixel,那么手机上默认的短信app 是message app,那么这个时候就需要到手表上安装对应的message app才能查看/回复短信。

有些手机的默认短信app不是message,比如三星，HTC等，有自己开发的message app，那这个时候就不用在手表上安装message app了，但是如果用户将手机的默认message app又改为了原生的message app，则需要在手表上安装message app。

It depends on your phone model. If your phone's default messaging app is the Message app, then you need to install the corresponding message app on your watch. Otherwise, there is no need to install a message app.

\(Knowledge: there is no need to tell the user\)

Some mobile phones are native Android, such as google pixel, then the default SMS app on the phone is the message app, then you need to install the corresponding message app on the watch to view/reply SMS.

Some mobile phones' default SMS app is not a message, such as Samsung, HTC, etc., which have their own message app, then you don't need to install the message app on your watch, but if the user changes the phone's default message app to the original message app, you need to install the message app on your watch.

#### 196.   1. 如果不打开always on 显示状态，表盘显示3秒后就会消失. 时间太短. 2.如果打开always on显示状态，等一会儿不操作的话，表盘的秒针后会消失.\(Ticwatch E\)"    "1. If the always on display status is not turned on, the watch face screen will disappear after 3 seconds. The time is too short. 2. If the always on display status is turned on, the second hand of the watch face will disappear after a while."

这都是正常的系统逻辑。

第1个问题，「始终开启屏幕」未开启时。熄屏时间有5秒，10秒2种情况。

第一种：熄屏状态下点亮屏幕不做任何操作后，为了省电，系统会5秒自动熄屏。

第二种：熄屏状态下点亮屏幕，做任何操作比如滑动屏幕，打开应用后，会10秒后熄屏。

第2个问题：打开「始终开启屏幕」后，熄屏进入的那个页面叫做ambient mode ,为了省电这个页面1分钟才会更新一次信息，所以没有秒针。

These are normal system logic.

1. ""Always On Screen"" is not turned on. The screen timeout has two options: 5 seconds and 10 seconds

The first type: After the screen is turned off and the screen is not operated, in order to save power, the system will automatically turn off the screen for 5 seconds.

The second type: Light up the screen when the screen is off, do any operation, such as sliding the screen, after opening the application, it will turn off after 10 seconds.

1. After turning on ""Always On Screen"", the page that goes out of the screen is called ambient mode. In order to save power, this page will update the information after a minute, so there is no second hand."

#### 198. Wear Fit Updates

You may have seen the announcement that the Google Fit App is now available on iOS 12.

A few important notes to keep in mind with this launch:

---FitKit will continue to exist and work seamlessly in the Wear companion app on iOS

---This launch provides the added option for users to download the Fit standalone app for a fuller experience.

---The standalone app will not be promoted in the companion app.

---The Fit iOS standalone app is fully compatible with Wear OS watches \(different types of activity sessions from the Watch will show up in their Journal\).

---Some users may occasionally experience a small delay between sessions showing up in their phone Journal after completing an actively tracked workout on the watch. This is a known issue. However, their HP's & MM's will be tracked and reflected in the meantime.

---The app integrates with HealthKit to bring iPhone paired WearOS users' other activities across the phone into Fit, combined with their activities on their watch. Fit does not write WearOS data to HealthKit. "
